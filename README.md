# Raman_BoseEinstein_Scaling
Raman scattering spectra --> Out-of-phase ("Imaginary") component of the Raman susceptibility. 

This C++ program takes a file with Raman spectrum (Wavenumber and Raman scattering intensity) and a specified temperature. It first checks that the input file has the right format (2 columns) and that there is no missing data. It then reads each wavenumber and intensity into a customly-declared datapoint structure. The intensity is scaled based on the Bose Einstein (BE) distribution for the temperature and each wavenumber (frequency). The scaled intensity is output to a file. An example input file "Bi25FeO39.txt" is provided. An input file with improper data is also provided "Improper_datafile.txt".

Compilation:
g++  -std=c++11  BoseCorrection.cpp  -o  bc.exe


Execution syntax:
bc.exe < Input_Filename >  < Temperature > < Output_Filename >

Execution example:
bc.exe Bi25FeO39.txt  373  output_file.txt
